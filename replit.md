# TechVision IT Solutions Website

## Overview
This is a static, multi-page corporate website for TechVision IT Solutions, an IT consulting company. The website is built using only frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) without any backend infrastructure, CMS, or database. It's designed to be a modern, professional showcase for the company's services and capabilities.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The project follows a traditional static website architecture with a focus on modern frontend development practices:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure Static Site**: Built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **Multi-page Structure**: Traditional navigation between separate HTML pages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Flexbox and Grid
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactive features

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with proper SEO meta tags
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (CSS variables), modern layout techniques
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries, pure DOM manipulation
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family for typography
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements

## Key Components

### Page Structure
The website consists of 10 main pages:
- **index.html**: Homepage with hero section and company overview
- **about.html**: Company story, mission, and vision
- **services.html**: IT services offered by the company
- **portfolio.html**: Project showcase and case studies
- **team.html**: Team member profiles
- **careers.html**: Job openings and company culture
- **blog.html**: Blog listing page
- **blog-single.html**: Individual blog post template
- **contact.html**: Contact form and company information
- **faq.html**: Frequently asked questions

### Navigation System
- Fixed header with dropdown menus
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Royal blue primary, cyan secondary, neon green accent
- **Typography**: Poppins font family with multiple weights
- **Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- **Animations**: Scroll-triggered animations and hover effects

## Data Flow
Since this is a static website, there's no traditional data flow. However, the architecture supports:

### Client-Side Interactions
- Form submissions (currently frontend-only, would need backend integration)
- Dynamic content filtering (portfolio, blog)
- Interactive animations and transitions
- Modal dialogs and overlays

### Content Management
- Static HTML content that can be updated manually
- CSS custom properties for easy theme customization
- Modular JavaScript for feature management

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library
- No JavaScript frameworks or libraries

### Third-party Integrations (Planned)
- Contact form would need email service integration
- Analytics tracking (Google Analytics)
- Social media sharing widgets
- Embedded maps for contact page

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
The website is designed for static hosting services:
- **Recommended Platforms**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or traditional web hosting
- **Build Process**: No build step required - direct deployment of files
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading with minimal dependencies
